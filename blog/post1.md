# Bypassing Trillion Dollar Company Restrictions with a Single Click

Everyone knows some of the biggest players in tech are Google and Microsoft. Both of these companies are valued at over a Trillion dollars each (that's twelve zeros!).

Sometimes companies like these decide they want to harvest more information than they already possess or some new bill or regulation is set in place that requires them to move the goal post from what they have to what they need, inconveniencing millions of people in the process, forcing them to jump through even more hoops and provide more personal information in order to continue using their service.

However, what is presented as a requirement actually doesn't have any perpetual safeguarding mechanism to enforce requiring input and instead is easily bypassed with minimal effort. 

I've been using this trick for the last 12+ years and it still works perfectly to this day against both Microsoft Outlook and Google's Gmail servers. And something tells me that if it works against them, it works against many more services as well.

The trick, ironically, is similar to what the solution to fixing it would be; a simple redirect. When logging in and faced with a request to provide a "Date of Birth" or "missing info" that was NOT required initially to create the account, the form is located on its own web page that doesn't actually return you to it if you navigate away on the same domain. All you have to do is simply click the URL, retype the website you were trying to use in the first place ('gmail.com' for example), and press Enter. And just like that, you're welcomed into your inbox with no more pesky data request.(Until you log in next time)

They could easily enforce this, but it seems like these particular massive mega-corporations care more about their profit margins or public image than actually protecting people, which is what they claim some of these information requests feign to do. To enforce it strictly, albeit simple to implement, would likely cause even further inconveniences to millions of people and surely some negative news stories that could potentially result in their stock price decreasing. But when human lives are at stake, especially children's, I find their lack of enthusiasm for their protection disappointing.

While I don't necessarily believe that every user of every website should have to upload their ID to participate, that's not to say we as an industry can't come up with an acceptable non-invasive security measure to ensure that users meet certain criteria. 

As technology becomes more advanced and accessible and new authentication protocols and methods are developed, it will certainly be interesting to see what the future holds.

And while it may be disheartening to see these trillion-dollar companies remain vulnerable to the same redirect bypass for many years, our future isn't in their hands - it's in our own. There are lots of other companies working towards building the future and I look forward to seeing what creative solutions are deployed in the years to come.
